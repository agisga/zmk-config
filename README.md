# Some ZMK config files

## Layout diagram for my Minidox keymap

- The layout is a heavily modified [miryoku (with MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP, MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT)](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/blob/master/data/layers/miryoku-kle-reference-flip-invertedt.png). But important differences from miryoku are:
    * Backspace is moved to the middle finger (usual comma position), because I was experiencing thumb issues resulting from overuse from thumb backspace;
    * Some tap-holds are replaced with sticky/one-shot keys, because I was experiencies thumb pain due to holding keys for layers, and, besides, I find one-shot Shift very enjoyable to use (gets rid of any delays due to capitalization in the flow of typing);
    * Custom macro layer.
- I was relying on combos for a long time, but eventually I found them less comportable compared to other alternatives. Besides, occasionally I would trigger them accidentally due to fat finger. Therefore, I moved on. Some important keys that don't fit into the base layer are accessed via double taps (tap dance): Double tap Shift for Enter, double tap Num for Esc.
- The visualization was produced using <https://caksoylar.github.io/keymap-drawer>.
