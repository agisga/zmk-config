## Layout diagram for my Minidox keymap

- Originally inspired by [miryoku (with MIRYOKU_LAYERS=FLIP, MIRYOKU_NAV=INVERTEDT)](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku/blob/master/data/layers/miryoku-kle-reference-flip-invertedt.png), but pretty far removed at this point.
- Backspace is moved to the middle finger (usual comma position), because I was experiencing thumb issues resulting from overuse from thumb backspace.
- Heavy reliance on sticky/one-shot keys, because I was experiencies thumb pain due to holding keys for layers, and, besides, I find one-shot Shift very enjoyable to use (gets rid of any delays due to capitalization in the flow of typing).
    * Numbers are accessed from a one-shot NUM layer (left thumb).
    * Symbols that usually require Shift are accessed by: one-shot shift (right thumb) -> one-shot NUM layer (left thumb) -> a right hand finger position on the NUM layer (for example, 5 gives %, 7 gives &, etc).
- Many custom macros for the type of typing I do on the FUN and NAV layers.
- I was relying on many combos for a long time, but eventually I found them less comfortable compared to other alternatives. Besides, occasionally I would trigger them accidentally due to fat finger. Therefore, I moved on. My 6 column keyboards have no combos, and my 5 column keyboards move the 6th column keys to horizontal combos of the inner-most two columns. Some important keys that don't fit into the base layer are accessed from the one-shot NUM layer or via double taps from the base layer (double tap Shift for Enter).
